# Database Flow

Running locally or on a shared server, Database Flow helps you discover and search your database using SQL and GraphQL. 
It provides a full-featured GraphQL server for your schema and a performance-oriented query interface.  

## Features

* Supports @ref:[PostgreSQL](database/postgresql.md), @ref:[MySQL](database/mysql.md), @ref:[SQLite](database/sqlite.md), @ref:[Oracle](database/oracle.md), @ref:[SQL Server](database/sqlserver.md), @ref:[H2](database/h2.md), @ref:[DB/2](database/db2.md), and @ref:[Informix](database/informix.md).
* Rich @ref:[SQL editor](feature/sqleditor.md) with auto-complete and live syntax checking based on your schema.
* Explore tables, views, and stored procedures. Share saved results, @ref:[charts](feature/charting.md), or sql queries.
* A sophisticated @ref:[GraphQL server](feature/graphql.md), providing a detailed and efficient graph for your schema and data.
* Supports local single-user app installations as well as a shared server mode for your whole team.
