# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the primary supported database for Database Flow, all features are tested on Postgres first. 
Queries, charting, and query plan visualization are all available.

The largest feature is @ref:[Database Export](../export/databaseExport.md), which is only supported for Postgres.
 
Please let us know on [Github](https://github.com/KyleU/databaseflow) if you find an issue.
